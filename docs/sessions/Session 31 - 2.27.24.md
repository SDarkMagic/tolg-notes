> 	before the calamity, a few bullywug seers predicted what would be the greatest cataclysm of all times, the end of time the great mage wubwub looked into the sacred foutain, and in the reflection, saw the beginning of the end  One day, a man so obsessed with days, was wishing to stop the very wheel of time so he studied, he bargained, he betrayed, he cheated, lied, destroyed and burned everything he could for the wheel cannot stop  so he forged alliances one with the green enchantress of manipulation one with the great flame beast of envy and one with the great eye of chaos for the wheel cannot stop  all them felt that time owed them  robbed them of glory and they would get what is due for the wheel cannot stop  but time , very much like a living thing, reacted every ripple creates waves and these waves became dreams  One wave from a tabaxi knight one from a fairy warrior one from a half-orc scholar one from a human archer one from an volatile sea elf one from a fire sorceress one from a tabaxi of fist and magic and one from a wizard of two worlds  Time would stop the man for obsession is nothing but forced meaning the great war is coming for the wheel cannot stop
