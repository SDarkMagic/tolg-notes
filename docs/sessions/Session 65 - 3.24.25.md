- [[Cain]] orders [[Viva]]'s monkey familiar to be killed seeing it's plugging her ears
- [[Melody]] incapacitates another [[Advena']]
- [[Abel]] breaks his restraint and begins moving towards [[Emi]] and [[Advena]]
- [[Abel]] then tries to stomp [[Isla]] dealing 24 damage
- He then turns to attack [[Ave]] with his other two attacks dealing 72 damage
- [[Fish]] attacks [[Abel]] and pushes him back 10 feet in the process
- [[Ardric]] casts hex on [[Abel]] giving him disadvantage on wisdom checks
- He then eldritch blasts pushing [[Abel]] away from [[Ave]]
- [[Advena]] begins her turn by asking [[Cain]] why he didn't treat her like a pawn
	- He actually cared about her apparently and wanted her to be something
	- In just a few months most likely almost all of us will no longer exist apparently
- She then vortex warps [[Viva]], leaving the monkey behind in the process
- The [[Advena']]s cast 7 fireballs on the monkey, hitting [[Ave]], [[Fish]], [[Advena]], and [[Emi]]
	- [[Isla]] counterspells one of them
- [[Fish]] uses his reaction to shunt the monkey out of the range of the fireballs
- [[Advena]] dies
- [[Ave]] dies
- [[Emi]] immediately goes to revivify [[Advena]]
- [[Emi]] sees [[Abel]]'s human form through the lens crying
- [[Cain]] growing bored, summons shadow spirits at the entrance
- [[Melody]] lands a crit on one of the [[Advena']]s, and uses his [[Cadence]] rune to redirect the damage onto [[Abel]]
	- 22d6 damage - 115 non-lethal damage
- *FIRST ATTACK DONE*
- He then hides and runs from where he just was to avoid danger
- [[Abel]] then runs towards [[Emi]], which through the lens looks like him crying and running for a hug, but he's just gonna come try to crush her actually
- [[Ave]], while dead, has a conversation in the void with a mysterious entity about a deal for her to come back at the cost of the life of the abandoned child
- [[Advena]] uses the [[Manyvoice Mask]] to instruct the other [[Advena']]s to "stand down" in the voice of [[Cain]]
- They accept this order and say "acknowledged master"
- [[Emi]] grabs [[Ave]]'s body and teleports her into a hallway to try and revivify her
	- This fails
- [[Cain]] says the code: "Redemption25VermillionNadine" and all the [[Advena']]s become "feral"
- [[Melody]] attacks [[Abel]], then tries to hide, with a nat 1 stealth
- [[Abel]] walks towards [[Emi]] and tries to unleash the shades on her, only for [[Advena]] to vortex warp her away leaving [[Miko]] to take all of the attack, and dying
- [[Isla]] moves the gem into [[Ardric]]'s radiance
- [[Abel]] moves to try and stomp [[Advena]] but doesn't manage to land the attack
- [[Emi]] takes the next attack which would have hit [[Advena]] using the power of doomed yuri
- [[Ave]] comes back from the dead, misses two shots, action surges, and shoots [[Abel]] twice
- [[Ardric]] tries to combine a sacred flame with eldritch blast
	- He hits the growing shadows from the main entrance, and it shrinks significantly
- [[Advena]] attacks [[Abel]] with a shadow blade, but he's still standing somehow
- [[Cain]] cannot remember what [[Ave]] likes
- [[Emi]] heals herself, [[Ave]], and [[Advena]]
- [[Melody]] downs [[Abel]], incapacitating him
- [[Abel]] self destructs as [[Cain]] remembers [[Ave]] likes bombs
	- This kills the surrounding [[Advena']]s who get caught in the blast
- [[Isla]] moves the gem into [[Ardric]]'s sickening radiance, making a concentrated beam to attack the shadow doing disintegrate damage but radiant
	- This cuts it in half killing it instantly
