# [[Melody]], [[Emi]], [[Advena]], [[Ave]], [[Olivia]] in the [[Fae Wild]]
- We're heading to the [[Fae Wild]] now
- There's a welcoming committee...
- [[Olivia]] no longer feels the effects of the full moon
- They've been standing here waiting almost half a day for us to show up?!
- Oh there's a hooded figure in the distance behind us who's been here for a while
- They have pale skin and long flowy hair that "seems familiar"
- A previously assumed abandoned area of the [[Fae Wild]] has recently had activity
- [[Emi]] begins wandering over to the figure
- They wander to a cottage and enter inside of it. [[Melody]] has no idea what this place is
- [[Olivia]] hears a very faint voice saying they aren't open for business as she approaches
- It's a tiny spider hanging from the door
- They're [[Magus]] and [[Methusalem]]
- We're going to rest at [[Cadence]]'s house, which has been very well maintained
- [[Advena]] and [[Emi]] take off their heels when entering so they don't hit their heads
- [[Melody]] is giving us a tour of the house
- As we each enter [[Cadence]]'s room, we shrink to be at scale with the room
- Paintings on the walls depict [[Cadence]]'s feats in life with additional creative liberties
- They were painted by the house
- A painting of [[Cadence]] standing atop a pile of dead creatures
- No one seems to know what this painting is of
- [[Melody]]'s room is unlocked, and we all shrink again as we enter the room
	- He had a glitter bucket that he would put over the door for when people walked in the room
- The room is a MESS
- We're talking about [[The Big Apple]] and [[The Elegists]]
- [[Melody]] spent ~16 years screwing with people in the city
- He has stolen a large quantity of random trinkets that people wouldn't miss
- [[The Elegists]] are a group of aberrations that have given the [[Fae]] a bad reputation
- [[Melody]] decided to try to prank [[The Elegists]] after being done with [[The Big Apple]]
	- This was not a good idea
- He was caught by one of them, and they messed with his head a good bit
- [[Cadence]] "took care" of a lot of them after seeing what they did to [[Melody]]
- He somewhat blames himself for this, and feels like he wasted his life
- We're the only people to have seen his room consensually since he was last here
- [[Olivia]] asks how [[Melody]] moved on from the guilt
- We leave the room and return to our normal sizes
- [[Melody]]'s father was a tanner, but is no longer in the picture
- There's also a reading area with some bookshelves in the house
# [[Fish]]/[[Ardric]] in the [[Material Plain]]
- [[Ardric]] and [[Fish]] separate ways so [[Fish]] can have some alone time with [[River]]
- [[River]] wants to talk about something very specific as they begin fishing
- He's talking with [[Fish]] about how valuable she is to him
- something something relationships
- [[Fish]] catches a minnow, and [[River]] catches a bass
- [[Fish]] is starting to fall asleep on the boat
- [[River]] was unaware of the fact that [[Olivia]] is a werewolf
- [[Ardric]] is staring at the moon and reaching out to his patron
	- Despite not getting an answer he feels like someone is listening
- He's requesting an answer to a question only the patron can answer at the right time
- [[Jason]] pokes his head out of the pocket and looks at [[Ardric]]
- He wants to know when exactly the end of time is
- [[Jason]] gets the book from [[Nott]] 
	- He then looks at the stars and moon and points in a direction
# [[Fae Wild]]
- We all awake from a long rest, and [[Ardric]] arrives at the house alongside [[Fish]]
- [[Melody]] is giving them the tour now
