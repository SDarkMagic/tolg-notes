# General
- The group wakes up, and goes to meet [[Advena]] and [[Emi]] by the portal in [[Serenity]]
- [[Fish]] and [[Olivia]] split off to go look for [[Vesta]]
- [[Ardric]], [[Emi]], [[Melody]], [[Ave]], and [[Advena]] go to check on the diamond mine
- [[Ardric]] talks with the [[magmans]] who are still in the cave to see if they know anything about the cave in.
- We consider sending [[Jason]] in to scout, then remember the area is full of lava
- [[Melody]] pulls out the chime opening, as [[Ardric]] casts identify on it to specifically define "opening"
- [[Jason]] slides under the rock at the entrance, and manages to enter the cave
- [[Ardric]] runs off and gets pickaxes for the entire party
- [[Ardric]] and [[Emi]] look at the rock to see where the best spot to dig is
- [[Ardric]], [[Emi]], and [[Ave]] begin digging, as [[Advena]] copies a scroll (nerd)
- [[Melody]] tries digging once, causes damage to the structural integrity of the rock, and immediately gives up
- The [[magmans]] come over, and ask [[Jason]] if they can help dig
- Meanwhile,[[Fish]] and [[Olivia]] make their way to [[Vesta]]
- [[Fish]] explains the dream that [[River]] had to [[Vesta]] asking if she has any insights on it
- [[Vesta]] says the gods are trying to contact someone somehow, but that they also have a limited amount of instances they can interfere with mortal affairs
- She then goes on to say if they mentioned the flower, the reincarnation process is absolutely protected, and we shouldn't worry about it
- [[Vesta]] says the dream is definitely [[Melora]] and [[Sehanine]] communicating that they're very excited to meet [[Olivia]]/[[Fish]]
- [[Fish]] and [[Olivia]] return to help the mining efforts with [[Vesta]] tagging along
- The two start trying to help, and the tunnel immediately begins to collapse
- [[Ardric]] uses telekinesis to stabilize the tunnel temporarily
- [[Emi]] uses plant growth to form a foundation for the tunnel to stabilize it
- We finally reach [[Jason]] after 8 hours of digging
- We then make our way into the mine, with [[Vesta]] taking a minute to wildshape into a fire elemental and dive into the lava
- The diamond extractor is in incredible disrepair, with several bites taken out of it
- [[Ave]] tries taking a bite out of it
- One of the [[magmans]] asks [[Ardric]] if he wants some of their useless rocks, and comes back with 900 gold worth of diamonds
- [[Ave]] challenges them to not eat the machine, and they accept it
- [[Advena]] gives [[Vesta]] a scroll of greater invisibility to give to [[Isla]]
- We all return to the cabin to rest
- On our way, to the cabin, we see [[Deborah|Debbie]]'s summer home *walk* into [[Serenity]] and settle down in the center
- [[Deborah]] offers to maintain forbiddance in [[Ardric]]'s absence, specifically on [[Serenity]]
- After outsourcing the casting of forbiddance on [[Serenity]] to the [[Hags]], we go to the church
- [[Nadine]] casts greater restoration on [[Melody]]
- [[Advena]] heads towards the library to check on [[Greelee]] after we get to [[Sthertiing]]
- He's asleep in a chair surrounded by books
- We make our way to [[Tawfret]], and hear a lot of noise as we get closer
- Only [[Olivia]] sees the silhouette of an airship in front of the mountain, as if there's something invisible covering it
- [[Ardric]] and [[Melody]] head towards [[Tawfret]] to try and talk with the [[Yeti]]s
- People that tried to approach the air ship got shot by a green laser (disintegrate)
- Two people that approached did not get shot. One of them had a lot of money. The other one had a blue suit and all white hair with an unpleasant temperament
- [[Ardric]] uses minor illusion to create a "Hi" in the sky trying to signal the airship, and a "firework" comes his way, as he gets hit by it and it says "move along peasant"
- [[Olivia]] fires an arrow clearly away from them, and the cannons all turn to face her
- She screams she has money, and the ship descends, deploying a red carpet and playing classical music
- We are greeted by an [[Air Genasi]] named [[Francis]] who asks what course we might be interested in taking
- ![[Pasted image 20250715133806.png]]
- He asks for a 5000 gold security deposit before we enter in case of accidents
	- [[Fish]] contributes 1000 gold
	- [[Emi]] contributes 2000 gold
	- [[Olivia]] contributes 2000 gold
- [[Olivia]] insights why the guy is only really interacting with [[Fish]] and [[Ardric]] and realizes he's just a misogynist.
- There is an entrance exam that must be passed before all of the knowledge in the university can be accessed
- A few members of the [[Dawnfrost]] apparently studied here
- "We've had the great Cain in this establishment."
- We're given a tour of the school
- There are statues watching the entire area, and the portals have detection magic about them
- We decide to take the exam first, after learning if we fail it we can still try the dungeon
