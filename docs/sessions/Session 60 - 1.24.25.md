# General
- Speculation about [[The Great Eye]] being behind the [[Dofleini]] disappearance is being had

- [[Ave]] goes to check on [[Olivia]] and discovers all of her belongings scattered across the rooms and [[Olivia]] curled up near a wall
- [[Olivia]] is currently sobbing onto [[Ave]]'s shoulder as she hugs her for comfort
- [[Melody]] asks [[Advena]] why exactly she brought [[Olivia]] back
- [[Advena]] responds that we weren't ready to bring her back how she wanted since we don't have the materials currently
- ***WRONG*** we're only missing the flower from [[Dofleini]] according to [[Emi]]
- [[Fish]] is understandably mad at [[Advena]] and responds passive aggressively to her reasoning
- [[Melody]] opens the cabin in the middle of the road so we can all get something to eat
	- The cabin is taller now with a second floor!
- [[Fish]] and [[Emi]] make their way over to check on [[Olivia]] and [[Ave]]
- Apparently, the cookie brick has a home now?!
- The cabin is a floating essence with a bellhop hat now too
- [[Advena]] casts identify on the cabin and senses its magical presence is much stronger now
- [[Olivia]] goes over to open the door for [[Fish]] and [[Emi]]
- [[Emi]] heals [[Olivia]] significantly better than [[Ave]] managed to
- GROUP HUG!!!!
- [[Ave]] makes a pair of sending stones for [[Fish]] and [[Olivia]]
- [[Melody]] finishes making a stew, as he and [[Ardric]] head outside with it taking [[Advena]] with them reluctantly
- The entire party now makes their way into the cabin
- The back of the cabin interior walls open and it begins to expand further back
- The cabin is significantly larger now inside
- The cookie brick has now scaled to 5 times its size and is hanging from the ceiling at the top of the stairs
- The nightwatch room at the top of the stairs reflects the dwellers' preferred environments around their vicinity while inside
- Awkward Family Dinner time in the void room
- [[Advena]] wrote a letter to [[Olivia]] and has [[Belle]] deliver it across the cabin
- People begin to head to bed
# Nightwatch
## [[Emi]], [[Melody]], and [[Ave]]
- Someone comes knocking at the door to the cabin
- A goblin pirate has come by asking if we're "open"
- They're currently on the run from debt collectors
- Her name is [[Rebecca]]
- Looking to get to [[Knotts]] to hide
- We've let her in to stay the night and she just wants to steal stuff
- [[Ave]] threatens her with a gun remotely
- We are locking this poor goblin in the first floor of the cabin
- The cabin is playing keep-away with [[Rebecca]]
- [[Melody]] cuts the mental link
- [[Advena]] visits [[Ardric]]'s room for a conversation
	- She wants advice on how to handle the feelings consequent from her actions
	- [[Ardric]] believes [[Advena]] has made a "grave error"
	- [[Advena]] is a bit jealous of [[Olivia]] for having the ability to potentially be rid of her curse
	- [[Advena]] tears up her devil contract
- [[Melody]] and [[Emi]] have a detailed conversation about death
- [[Ave]] finds solace in the idea that there is nothing after death. Just the end.
- [[Melody]] believes it's worth it for the party to be more open with each other
## [[Advena]] and [[Fish]]
- Incredibly tense small talk is transpiring
- [[Fish]] has dropped the harpoon he was sharpening and unsheathed his claws
- He asks if [[Advena]] is even sorry, to which she is unsure
- Everything [[Advena]] says seems to just be making this situation worse for herself
- [[Advena]] realizes she's wronged [[Olivia]], but still has her reservations
- nvm she acknowledges she messed up?!
	- nope she's spiraling
- She has no idea how to help people instead of hurting them even on accident
- [[Fish]]'s anger has dissipated for the most part at this revelation
-
