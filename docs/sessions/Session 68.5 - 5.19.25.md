# General
- [[Ardric]] casts remove curse on [[Emi]] while she heals herself
- [[Melody]] also gets healed and remove cursed
- [[Isla]] is still being carried by [[Melody]]
- She is starting to leak blood from her eye again
- [[Fish]] silences [[Isla]] with a gag
- [[Melody]] pulls out the cabin, and [[Advena]] immediately goes in to her room
- [[Melody]] manifests a back to one of the stools in the lower room, then ties [[Isla]] to it
- [[Ardric]] tries to explain the situation to [[Isla]] however she doesn't appear to understand
- [[Isla]] says it's still in there after [[Emi]] asks her about it in primordial
- She asks [[Ardric]] to try remove curse on her, but he needs to wait 20 minutes
- [[Melody]] goes to check on [[Advena]] who is laying  still on her bed
- [[Ardric]] uses remove curse on [[Isla]], however it only seems to suppress the tadpole and would need a greater restoration or similar to remove it
- [[Emi]] casts greater restoration on [[Isla]], removing the tadpole
- [[Isla]] claims to only remember feelings from the past 24 hours, however she remembers [[Cedric]] appearing in the [[astral plain]] to aid us
- She joined our group for the purpose of leading us somewhere
- [[Melody]] asks [[Advena]] over the mental link if she wants to be kept up to date (she does)
- [[Ardric]] asks what the last thing [[Isla]] remembers comprehensively is
	- She remembers being home (underwater in a cave)
	- Came back from a supply run, however after a while the water in the cavern began to drain
	- Her mother was turned to stone in front of her
	- Taken with them through the portal, then gets fuzzy
- [[Isla]] was "chosen" to be useful to the [[illithids]]
- They gave her the necklace she uses for spellcasting to channel the magic [[The Great Eye]] gave her
- She had something tattooed onto her upper back
	- tattoo of the eye
- Others have gone through this process (the ones not turned into [[Mind flayer]]s)
- Something was put into her eye (not a tadpole)
- [[Emi]] has the same thing, however [[Isla]] says the details are fuzzy of what exactly it is
	- It's an infection
- [[Isla]] doesn't think it's completely gone after the healing spell from [[Emi]], however she feels in control now
- She brought us there to try and have us join [[The Great Eye]]
- [[Isla]] wanted us to join by our own choice so we could stay as ourselves
- She says we can't just kill the eye because it would instantly turn anyone that's infected
- [[The Great Eye]] wants to endure in any way possible
- This is what she's known for 20 years
- [[Melody]] asks [[Isla]] if she knows what happened to the others that were turned to stone
	- She is unsure
- She then says that the incision was necessary to spread the infection 20 years ago, however it isn't any longer
- It's called the [[Sleeper Infection]]
- It apparently makes the infected weaker to being overtaken by [[The Great Eye]]
- It wanted her to lie to us about having any knowledge of its existence
- [[Isla]] herself did not want to kill us when we were in the most recent battle
- [[Emi]] says she understands what [[Isla]] is dealing with, but she still hates her for what she did
- We're leaving [[Isla]] to sleep in the lower room for the night
- [[Isla]] is released from her ties, making [[Fish]] apprehensive
- [[Ardric]] casts teleportation circle and takes himself, [[Melody]], and [[Fish]] to [[Sthertiing]]
- He then casts forbiddance over [[Sthertiing]]

	- She wildshapes a cat to comfort [[Advena]]
	- [[Advena]] views herself as a monster because she's hurt people
