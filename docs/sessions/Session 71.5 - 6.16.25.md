# General
- We decompress in the cabin and eat croissants for dinner
- [[Advena]] comes back through the door to the cabin with her mask on
	- [[Olivia]], [[Fish]], and [[Jason]] notice that her face is flushed and beet red as she turns to go sit at a table
- [[Olivia]] brings the [[invoice]] we found over to [[Ardric]]
- [[Advena]] has a feeling she's seen this [[invoice]] before
- The group is generally confused about the paper, however [[Ardric]] mentions the only context he has for airships is relating to the [[Air Genasi]]
- [[Emi]] comes in to join the group
- [[Ardric]] deduces "U.A.G" could stand for "University of Air Genasi"
- [[Ardric]] magically turns his stool into a powered wheelchair
- He wants to go recast forbiddance on places, however [[Emi]] stops him telling him to rest a bit first
- [[Olivia]] carries [[Melody]] with the group upstairs 
- The observation room turns into an infirmary as the group enters
- [[Olivia]] tells [[Fish]] she doesn't want to be alone tonight, so they agree to share a room for the night
- As [[Emi]] gets [[Ardric]] to his room, she practically collapses against a desk, barely managing to support herself
- He expounds upon the crown to her, and the developments that have been made regarding it
- [[Emi]] asks if we would try to kill her as well if she were to fall under the control of [[The Great Eye]]
- [[Ardric]] casts meld with stone to sleep in a rock, to [[Emi]]'s shock
- She then leaves him to sleep
- [[Fish]] and [[Olivia]] wonder upon how they've changed over the course of their journeys while looking into a mirror
- After discussing their respective discomforts in their own bodies, the conversation then moves to [[Olivia]]'s talk with [[Advena]] earlier in the day
- After a while, the two fall asleep
- [[Advena]] finishes casting alarm and goes to check up on [[Ave]]
- They discuss the Elven migration
- [[Advena]] leaves and heads back to her room
- [[Emi]] comes to check on [[Ave]]
- She enters the room and asks why [[Ave]] was reading about necromancy in the library earlier
- [[Emi]] then finally heads to be herself
- As [[Emi]] casts scrying, her vision shoots up to the sky, then plummets right back to looking at [[Advena]] in her room, writing on a scroll
---------------
- [[Ardric]] is the first to awake, bursting out into the empty hallway joyously proclaiming he has bodily function again
- He then goes to check on [[Melody]], triggering the alarm that [[Advena]] set, causing her to week up
- The two then go downstairs and begin making breakfast
- The two then discuss [[Advena]]'s "apology" to [[Olivia]]
- [[Melody]] awakens, speaking through the [[bellhop]] to [[Advena]] and [[Ardric]]
- [[Advena]] and [[Ardric]] bring him up to speed on what happened after he passed out
- [[Fish]] and [[Olivia]] wake up together, and [[Fish]] tries to explain his feelings for her
	- The feelings are mutual, but not traditional romantic love
- As everyone collects downstairs, we begin discussing our next objective
- [[Ardric]] and [[Ave]] teleport away to setup forbiddance on towns
- [[Emi]] is avoiding eye contact with [[Advena]]
- [[Melody]] has not fully processed the events of the previous day still
- [[Ardric]] is asking [[Ave]] about the terms of her deal with the [[Raven Queen]]
- [[Emi]] and [[Advena]] go out on a walk together to talk in private
- [[Advena]] tells [[Emi]] that she lost her contingency statue in the [[Fae Wild]]
- [[Advena]] tells [[Emi]] that [[Nadine]] was outside the cabin waiting to talk to her yesterday
- "It's all fine" -[[Advena]]
- [[Nadine]] told [[Advena]] to wed [[Emi]]
- [[Advena]] immediately tries to backpedal after telling [[Emi]] this, saying "We're friends", as [[Emi]] is holding her face
- They both *finally* admit they have some kind of feeling towards each other, and don't want to lose each other
- [[Emi]] kisses the inside of [[Advena]]'s wrist

- idek how to take good notes on this I'll be real. Just go watch the vod
- [[Emi]] tells [[Advena]] that she thinks she might be the "Mrs. LS" mentioned on the [[invoice]]
- As [[Ardric]] and [[Ave]] return, they pass [[Advena]] and [[Emi]]
- [[Melody]] is fast asleep on a pillow on the counter, and almost rolls off in his sleep
