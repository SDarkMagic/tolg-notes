## Fire Room
- [[Emi]] grabs [[Advena]]'s face and looks into her eyes to see if she's a robot
- [[Emi]] doesn't see anything
- There is an automated defense turret in the top left room with a head that looks similar to [[Belphegor]]
- [[Emi]] casts wall of stone in the room, and the turret begins to pump lava
- When [[Emi]] becomes unhidden and enters the room, the turret turns to face her
- [[Miko]] and [[Belle]] get sent into the room to scout
- As [[Belle]] enters the room, she gets sucked into the mouth of the turret, causing [[Advena]] to pull her out immediately
- As [[Miko]] tries to cross the wall in the room to the other side, the turret creates waves in the lava
- This destroys all of the walls
- [[Advena]] notices a lever higher up that seems to be connected to the turret somehow
- [[Miko]] falls into the lava, but is otherwise unharmed
- [[Advena]] casts cone of cold on the machinery, freezing it
- [[Emi]] gets on the broom and flies across to the other side of the room alone
- There is a pillar with a brazier that says "burn me"
- [[Emi]] lights it on fire
- As this occurs, another symbol on the main door lights up
- The turret has re-activated by this point, and is looking at [[Emi]]
- [[Advena]] vortex warps [[Emi]] back across the room to her
- She then asks [[Emi]] to come with her as she asks some questions to [[Advena']]
- [[Advena]] also gets a feeling of deja vu from the turret for some reason?
## Plant Room
- [[Melody]] and [[Fish]] try to figure out how exactly the plants work and if they are one mind
- [[Ardric]] sees this happening and holds up the acorn charm excitedly
- [[Melody]] uses druid craft to ward away the spores from himself
- [[Fish]] casts mage hand to follow [[Melody]] as he and [[Melody]] try to sneak through the room
- He also covers his face with a scarf to prevent himself from breathing in the spores
- [[Ardric]] speaks to the plant, and learns they hunger for flesh
	- "The man brought us here by force"
- The plants seem to be from the [[Fae Wild]]
- [[Ardric]] is now talking to the plants in sylvan out loud
- [[Melody]] has heard of this plant in the [[Fae Wild]] called the [[wingclipper]], but it's mainly used as a story to scare smaller fairies
- As [[Melody]] gets to the opposite side of the room, he finds a pedestal that the banana must be placed on
- [[Ardric]] is bargaining with the plant for the banana appendage
- The plant offers it in exchange for feeding and being sent back to where it came from
- [[Ardric]] casts suggestion on the plant to give him the banana
	- It gets a wisdom save of 19 and succeeds
- There's also a narrow tunnel back to the main room from this room
- As [[Ardric]] is talking with the plant, [[Melody]] tries to cut the banana off and misty step back up to where [[Fish]] is
	- This succeeds
- [[Fish]] grabs the banana with mage hand, and the two place it on the pedestal
- [[Melody]] then casts reduce on [[Fish]] so they can both fit through the passage back to the main room
- 
## Water Room
- Meanwhile, [[Ave]] and [[Isla]] investigate the room to the lower left
- This room is completely filled with water
- [[Isla]] notices that the movement of the waves is a bit off
- [[Ave]] uses a water testing kit on the water, and as it enters it takes 45 acid damage
- Shape water does not affect the "water" in front of us
- The two exit the room to see about getting help from the others
- [[Ave]] heads back to the room
- There is a wheel connected to the drainage system
- She then turns the wheel
- She manages to dodge an appendage that tries to grab her and drains what was a gelatinous cube from the room
- The room is now clear, as [[Isla]] and [[Ave]] reach an altar at the end
- [[Ave]] puts water from her armor into the altar after immediately solving the riddle written on it
# General
- The door in the main room vanishes as all of the puzzles are complete
- [[Emi]] and [[Advena]] approach [[Advena']] who seems worried and happy that the door is now open
- [[Advena']] warns [[Advena]] that there will be a lot more of them in the next room and she is not confident about what the state of them will be
- [[Advena]] removes her glove and touches the other on her cheek
	- It feels like cold metal
- [[Advena']] used to feel warm to the touch, but it broke down over time as she stopped being updated and repaired
- Someone risked her life to save all of the [[Advena']] from being disposed of
- She remembers being activated and finally meeting her, to only realize her purpose was a "corruption"
- The "original" Advena hated [[Advena']]
- When [[Cain]] realized that Advena didn't want [[Advena'|them]] he had them all deactivated
- [[Advena]] names this [[Advena']] [[Viva]]
- [[Advena]] gives a hug to [[Viva]]
- Deprecated code in the [[Advena']] codebase that has NOT been maintained sets their favorite spell to vortex warp
- [[Cain]] is working with [[The Great Eye]] despite it being something he swore he would never do
- [[Melody]] checks down the main hallway, and finds what seems to be a large power source surrounded by several deactivated [[Advena']]
- We put the sending stone [[Cain]] left with us into a bag of holding
- As we enter the main room, we notice a gem being powered by presumably the several [[Advena']] units around the room
- [[Emi]] looks at the crystal, and her eye begins to spiral
	- She hears a voice in her head, [[Cain]]
		- He wants to inform her about why he hates her so much
		- He says [[Emi]] destroyed "her" life
		- He believes [[Nadine]] could have been the greatest mage of her time
		- Also he thanks her for stepping in the inner sanctum of the lab and says the next part will be "fun"
- When [[Melody]] looks at the gem through the lens, he can see a portal contained within
- Nobody saw [[Emi]]'s eye do the spiral thing
- [[Viva]] says that if [[Cain]]'s voice is heard by the other [[Advena']] in the room, they could start and attack us
- [[Advena]] tries to pull one of the [[Advena']]s off the ring, and succeeds
- As she does this, the eyes of this unit open, and she says "they are here master"
- All of them open their eyes
- [[Cain]] starts talking from thin air, and has words for [[Advena]] and [[Emi]]
- He says that [[Advena]]'s family is none the wiser that she's gone and a replacement has been enacted in her stead
- Each of the [[Advena']]s has a portion of [[Advena]]'s memory, and killing them would remove it
- He then teleports [[Abel]] 2.0 into the room for us to fight
- Initiative time!
- [[Cain]] has all of the [[Advena']]s destroy the crystal in the center (which we need)
- [[Melody]] incapacitates one of them by shooting her arms off
- [[Isla]] begins moving the gem telekinetically towards us
- As this happens, legendary action we're locked in here
- [[Abel]], while restrained, tries to use his arms to open his "chest cannon"
- [[Ave]] runs up and punches [[Abel]] with a thunder gauntlet so he prioritizes targeting her
- [[Ardric]] targets a few of the [[Advena']]s and careful spells them so as not to kill
- He then telekinetic shoves the gem, ending his turn
- [[Advena]] pulls [[Viva]] back and has the familiars cover her ears
- She then places an invisible wall of force in front of the gem
- The [[Advena']]s all try to vortex warp everyone but [[Ardric]] and [[Melody]]
- [[Advena]] is the only one to fail, and gets sent to in front of [[abel]]
- [[Ave]] and [[advena]] now have to do all six saving throw types at once
- [[Advena]] fails all the saves:
	- becoming restrained
	- taking 40 necrotic damage
	- becoming poisoned
	- becoming slowed
	- Afflicted with fear
	- disadvantage on next action
- [[Ave]] is also afraid and has disadvantage on next action
- one of the [[Advena']]s tries to cast shatter on them gem, but [[Isla]] counter-spells it
-
