# General
- [[Emi]] shuttles everyone back across the lava pool sequentially
- The three red dragons from earlier have left the room
- Tiny hut hours again, courtesy of [[Ardric]]
- One of the red dragons is heading back up talking to the [[draconids]] mentioning a request for an audience with [[Belphegor]]
- The dragon walks past but the [[draconids]] do not follow in
- Red dragon is asking where [[Belphegor]] is
- [[Ardric]] sends a message to [[Mammon]] asking where he is
	- He replies that he's at the entrance, and they "Won't let him in"
- [[Advena]] casts message on the red dragon to try and make him think he had the original idea to check the front door
- [[Melody]] adds the dragon to the mental link and gaslights him into thinking he had the idea
- We got one of the [[draconids]] promoted ([[Drake]])
- [[Melody]] is gaslighting [[Drake]] to get them all to check the front door too
- They are all now threatening each other
- [[Ardric]] is checking in on [[Distant Rain]] where he sees [[River]] standing on a roof looking into the distance and everyone is prepared to leave
- welp, we still don't really know how to get out of this situation
- Red dragon comes back, sees the chaos, and asks what's happening
- Everyone must gather in the main hall for an audience because [[Mammon]] is here
- [[Chromatic parliment]] has been called
- [[Ardric]] casts invisibility on [[Advena]], [[Ave]], [[Fish]], and [[Emi]]
- [[Ave]] and [[Fish]] are looking at rocks
	- They are a mix of adamantine and another unknown material that makes lava when heated
- [[Ave]] and [[Fish]] both try to take some of the rock, and damage 2/3 of them
	- [[Emi]] tries, and managed to get a few pounds of the material
- [[Melody]] gets directions and blurs past the [[draconid]] he was talking to
- [[Melody]] is attempting to do this with the second guard station
- This works
- The last door is locked, and the guards say only the higher ups have the key
- [[Melody]] takes out the chime of opening saying it's the key
- We enter the hatchery, where there are two eggs in the lava, and wyverns patrolling
- The wyverns are looking at [[Olivia]] and [[Melody]] like they're a good snack
- [[Ardric]] awakened minds the wyverns and tells them there his prey
- He intimidates the wyverns and they screw off
- ![[Pasted image 20241002114722.png]]
- we found [[Mammon]]
- [[Mammon]] says that everyone is present, although [[Leviathan]] is sadly absent
- [[Belphegor]] had a kid
- [[Mammon]] is challenging [[Belphegor]]'s ruling of the [[Chromatic Order]] and proposing he become leader of the order again
- SHOULD WE INTRODUCE DEMOCRACY??!?!?
- [[Melody]] is taking [[Fish]] to try and say they killed [[Belphegor]] then pass the leadership to [[Mammon]]
- [[Melody]] takes responsibility for the kill on [[Belphegor]] and throws the claw on the floor
- [[Olivia]] casts silence on the child.
- [[Fish]] is shown as the one to kill [[Belphegor]], and the child goes mad
- Another dragon enters
- it's [[Cain]]
- He's trying to take control of the dragons himself
- [[Advena]] attempts to dispel magic on the statue

- [[Ave]] takes [[Etna]]'s skeleton out of the bag partially
- [[Mammon]] steps up after [[Melody]] mental links to him telling him this is his responsibility
- [[Ardric]] is now attempting to share his memories with the fence-sitters of the draconic populace present
- We're showing the green dragon [[Belphegor]] killing his partner
- Votes shall now be cast
	- [[Belphegor Jr. 9th]] gets 0 votes
		- [[Mammon]] grounds him immediately
	- [[Mammon]] gets 2 of the larger dragons and one army initially
	- [[Cain]] gets two armies, and one red dragon initially
	- It's a tie currently, and the two abstinate parties must now vote
		- Green dragon votes for [[Mammon]]
		- The other red dragon also sides with [[Mammon]] seeing the vote go that way
- [[Mammon]] win. [[Mammon]] good. we all know this.
