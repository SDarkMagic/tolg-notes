## [[Ardric]] dream time
- **CLOCK MUSIC**
- [[Cain]] is in [[Ardric]]'s home in the dream?!
	- he canonically lives rent free in [[Ardric]]'s head

	- [[Cain]] ships [[Emi]] and [[Ardric]] 
- [[Kupex]] is back and wants revenge
- nvm [[Cain]] is degrading [[Ardric]] now
- [[Cain]] does not care where power comes from, he simply sees it as power. The more power the better.
- [[Cain]] never cared about a glorious reason or big ideal. He has acknowledged that he only cares about himself and his gain. He believe people are inherently selfish and this cannot be changed
- "This world is beautiful, and it's a deep shame you can't see that." - [[Ardric]] to [[Cain]]
