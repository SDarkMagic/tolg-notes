# General
- Final preparations are made before approaching [[Belphegor]]'s lair
- [[Ardric]] casts wheel or woe, and it turns out getting there will be both wheel and woe whatever that means
- [[Melody]] flies back to [[Ardric]] and [[Emi]] as we approach the lair, telling them we're actually here to confront [[Belphegor]]
- [[Emi]] casts pass without a trace on the party as we approach to enter
- [[Ardric]] brought his horse all the way up the mountain, only to learn it cannot fit through the entrance we were planning on using
- ![[Pasted image 20240911124318.png]]
- So this entrance was an idea...
- Anyways, we're being characaturized as child killers by a [[Red Abishai]] preaching to a congregation that all seem to be armed
- Top doorway is armory and communications, west is mining and research
- [[Advena]] gives [[Belle]] a dagger to put in her mouth, then sends her off to the side
	- [[Melody]] also makes [[Belle]] look like a giant rat
- None of them notice [[Belle]]
- They take a break from their sermon to attack [[Belle]] in an attempt to kill the rat
- We split the groups in half. Squad A+B are chasing [[Belle]]
- [[Belle]] encounters a giant crystalline dragon statue that says "This isn't your true form little one"
- [[Fish]] is now searching for god in this room
	- There's a statue of a 5 headed dragon on the east wall of the room
- [[Belle]] continues on to the next room where a green dragon is talking to [[Belphegor]] through a mirror
	- They're working on an alternative to Project Lemonade and need the help of you know who to make it work, but [[Belphegor]] disagrees
- [[Ardric]] attempts to minor illusion speak to the [[Red Abishai]] and convince him to evacuate
- This works, we've sent the dragons on a rat crusade
- Squad A attacks rat-[[Belle]] much to the green dragons confusion
- We're waiting for the [[Red Abishai]] to come guide the second squad out of the room
- He takes them out and now we're looking for traps and security measures
- We're perplexed by how to open this chest
- [[Ardric]] is using telekinesis the chest while [[Melody]] uses the chime of opening on it
	- This is a layered chest, [[Melody]] is expending multiple chime of opening charges on this
- Final layer has a note from [[Cain]] saying "It's been a pleasure working with you [[Belphegor]]"
- [[Advena]] uses dispell magic on the last layer, making it inert and removing the alarm spell from it
- [[Melody]] picks the final lock, and inside we find 5 arrows of slaying, a dragon slayer sword, and a frost brand
- We take the stuff then close the chest
- Short rest time, [[Melody]] gives [[Ave]] his mother's dagger to infuse with the dragon slayer sword's properties
- [[Ardric]] casts tiny hut while we short rest
- [[Ave]] effortlessly infuses the magical property into [[Melody]]'s dagger
- [[Cain]] calls in on the mirror to tell [[Belphegor]] one of the items stopped emanating magic energy. He's gonna raise the alarm on the lair if no response is sent
- He's counting to 5
- [[Olivia]] is casting sending to [[Cain]] with her voice masked as the [[Red Abishai]] telling him [[Belphegor]] ordered the items to be moved
- We now need a name and station of the guy we're impersonating
- He doesn't actually care about the name or title, and he doesn't believe us
- [[Cain]] is belittling [[Emi]], to which [[Emi]] blasts the mirror and [[Ave]] throws a bomb at the mirror
- His pocket watch is not his phyllactory
- [[Emi]] has destroyed the mirror, however [[Cain]] is still here
- He "says" he won't raise the alarm because he's too entertained by the thought of [[Team One Large Guy|TOLG]] taking on [[Belphegor]]
	- both [[Olivia]] and [[Ave]] succeed an insight check to know he's not lying
- In the next room is a statue of a devil that some of us have seen before
- [[Emi]] is hearing a voice in her mind as we're crossing the lava room
- Someone is writing in [[Emi]]'s pocket
- Stopping above solid land, [[Emi]] opens her scroll to see that is just says "Save me my little Lily" over and over while still being actively written
- It's in [[Abel]]'s handwriting
- [[Advena]] uses detect magic and there's a **LOT** coming from both the scroll and the statue
- ![[Pasted image 20240911143422.png]]
- Next room has 3 adult red dragons filling the lava lake
- [[Ave]]'s contract has been changed, but she's gonna look at it later
- We're trying to figure out if we can negotiate with the green dragon
- [[Advena]] casts fly on [[Fish]], [[Olivia]], herself, and [[Ave]]
- [[Ardric]] is using major illusion to try and conceal us
- We almost fully collide with a dragon as we're moving across the ceiling
- A large door blocks our path, with a receptacle labelled offering in front of it
- [[Melody]] dumps the entirety of the 2560 gold we got from drinking poison at the tavern a wild ago
- A total of 5000 gold is needed
- we pay the toll, and see a path leading to a chapel
- We're flying down the path to see if we can find anything
- In the lava before us, there's a large head similar to the one we saw in the [[Underdark]]
- [[Belphegor]] has grabbed [[Melody]]
- oh he's filled the room with lava now
- He's now jumping into the lava with [[Melody]]
- [[Belphegor]] belphs fire on [[Fish]], [[Olivia]], [[Advena]], and [[Ave]] doing 92 damage
- [[Melody]] misty steps out of the grapple
- [[Olivia]]'s turn to take a swim in the lava
-
