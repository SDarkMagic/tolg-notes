> 	 Cadence dawnfrost notes Ugh , another meeting today, they never warn you in the stories of how absolutely boring maintaining a peaceful alliance of all kingdoms can be I'm a skull cracker, I CRACK SKULLS! IT'S WHAT I DO, not write reports about "is there enough apples for the east part of the west thing with the north blah blah blah" They're all impressed of how fast i write, but im only that fast because im BOOOOOORRRRREEEEEED Hopefully I'll get use to it as i get older Wish i could be more like etna, even with all that's happening in her home, she's still here and listening to everyones request, poor thing, I've heard about all the stillborn she's been having recently. She says it's a common problem with a lot of dragons but i can see how her eyes are barely holding on to happiness Not that it's Mammon fault, he looks so kind with her at all time, trying his best to comfort her while maintaining his duties, if i ever have a boy, I'll try my best to raise him like that big ol snow softie Then of course my girl vesta, probably as bored as me, just looking to do anything else than be here. Having me and her in a meeting is like using 2 legendary weapons to play fey checkers (very different from material plane checkers) Love how she keeps changing her fingers from bear paw back to fingers to kill time Sunrise? Oh he is living his BEST LIFE, that little church cat feels so much in his element right now! Its quite refreshing to see him so vocal and confident, vocal and confident about numbers and logistics but still! I guess being raised in a monastery, this feels closer to home for him than going out there Oh yeah there is deborah, f that bitch Also the last squirrel representative died of old age. They say his successor, mog, is already getting briefed on the position And then, HIM, mister little smug ass face time himself, cain Truth is, he never was that bad, but recently, after he asked me the weirdest question, he just got really distant 
> 	 Like, who just comes in and say "what did you see when you died?" And i even replied quickly too, i saw my loved one in a very pretty place as i was sharing memories with them The look he gave me, was it anger? Jealousy? Disgust? What was i supposed to say? I'm sorry for seeing things when i die? What a weirdo, i can't see what vesta sees in him Wait, is vesta pregnant?
