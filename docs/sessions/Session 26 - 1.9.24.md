# Ave's Perspective
- Maggot Man ([[Us]]) might have met [[Cain]], [[Deborah]], and [Ave's mother](Awan.md)
	- Warned about [[Ardric]] acting any differently or showing black tentacles/manifestations in the eyes
	- Bullet upgrade!
	- [[Ave]] has not been paying enough attention to [[Ardric]] to have noticed any of these occurrences
- Returns to the group during the beginning of the third watch
- Talk to [[Fish]] about the ocean

# General
- [[Barren Height]] attempting to cast spells from inside the cabin
- [[Melody]] collapses the cabin, ejecting everyone
- Entire party attempts to prevent [[Barren Height]] from casting spells
- [[Barren Height]] attempts to cast banishment on himself to escape. Gets counterspelled by [[Ardric]]. Continues arguing that [[Emi]] is hiding stuff from the party and trying to actively hurt them all.
	- [[Barren Height]] simply tells [[Cedric]] to run
	- [[Cedric]] does not run since there isn't enough evidence
- Party takes restrained [[Barren Height]] back into the cabin after [[Melody]] re-opens it
- [[Fish]] and [[Ardric]] take the next watch
	- [[Ardric]] investigating the crown, which is in better condition no for some reason
	- He sees a reflection of himself with pitch black eyes that is pointing at him
	- Conversation regarding their respective powers from higher entities
	- Something about how loved ones are sent on to the [[astral plain]]
- [[Advena]] and [[Emi]] take third watch
	- [[Ave]] rejoins the group
	- [[Advena]] questions why [[Emi]] trusts the party to watch her back but doesn't trust them with the truth
	- [[Emi]] didn't want to put the party in "danger" and wanted to deal with it on her own
	- She has no idea what [[Barren Height]] was talking about
	- OH YEAH THE CLOCK MUSIC STARTED AGAIN?!?
	- [[Emi]] was telling the truth
	- ![[cain in the room.png]]
	- [[Ardric]] convulsing in his sleep?!?!
		- Sees himself with completely blackened eyes approaching him
		- [[Cain]] appears behind [[Ardric]] and says "Time's up"?!
		- [[Ardric]] tries to dimension door out, Gab pulls shenanigans and says no
		- Wakes up as the crown touches his head
	- identify cast through [[Jason]] on the crown; necromancy and transmutation magic. Appears to change the person wearing it to a new body for the creature to inhabit
	- [[Ardric]] is reluctant to destroy it
	- [[Advena]] attempts to dispell magic on the crown, crown shakes for a moment then falls to the ground
	- re-identify does not detect anything
	- Nat 1 trying to shoot the crown to prevent [[Ardric]] from putting the crown on
	- Ardric **REALLY** does not want this crown destroyed
	- Crown currently non-magical, blow it up?
	- [[Advena]] detects thoughts on [[Ardric]]
		- Ardric believes he is telling the truth on the surface level
		- No malevolent or evil thoughts deeper down
		- Desire to keep the crown is present
	- Vote on what to do with the crown:
		- Destroy
		- Keep on our person
		- Keep in safe location
	- [[Emi]] genuinely would have told the party about the crown if she found it?!?!
	- Crown is kept on our person
