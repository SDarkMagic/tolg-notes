# General
- [[Ardric]]  holds important part of the future. Entire party in fact does
	- We are hearing this from [[Caiphon]] through [[Jason]]
	- [[Cain]] is aware of this and wants us gone?
- Entire party offered battle knowledge
- [[Jason]] gets the anti spiral eyes
- Everyone gets a fighting style now ig
- [[Caiphon]] is going to attempt to prevent [[The Great Eye]] from coming back
- The crown is from [[Cain]], apparently being used to manipulate [[Ardric]]
- [[Olivia]] is now in possession of the crown
- We are in the [[Temple of Caiphon]] currently. Previous room has a statue of [[Ave]]'s mom
- [[Melody]] thinks [[Awan]] is gorgeous or smth ig
- Different rooms are all taken from different regions of the [[Material Plain]] 
- The cat is [[Lord Timmin]] or smth ig
- also I guess we are dragging [[Justin Spic]] along with us now since [[Melody]] promised to cook for him later or slit his throat
- [[Ardric]] is very territorial about this crown
- [[Ardric]] doesn't trust [[Olivia]] ig
- Mans is perfectly fine with just dying
- [[Ardric]] sees the rest of the party as contingencies for if he fails
- "We are not who we are by the actions we did in the past, we are because of the actions we do." - [[Melody]]
- *30 minutes later* **PLOT PROGRESSION WOO** we are now going up to the eye dudes

- Justin volunteers as tribute. almost forgor insight check
	- he was gonna squeal

- [[Olivia]] remembers she can speak with animals. It is time to commune with [[Lord Timmin|The cat]] 
- Cat is putting in a good word. The backup plan is murder
- Magical cat door appears and [[Lord Timmin]] goes in
	- this man rules the place. We get to leave with no eye stuff
	- [[Ave]] overcomplicates rebuilding a furnace
- We are in a new area of the fey wild [[Emi]] knows about this place
- Random sylvans here now I guess. Apparently they know [[Emi]]
- [[Syliva]] is the dryad we meet

- [[Emi]] has chosen to not tell us about ANY of this despite CLEARLY knowing about it
	- visited here while she was wandering the [[Fae Wild]]

- Residents of [[Blossom]] would have felt it if [[Amber Thornclaw]] had died
