- People are leaving the library to check on [[Artemicion]], while [[Emi]], [[Melody]], and [[Advena]] are staying behind
- [[Advena]] wants to talk with [[Emi]] about something, which is why those two stayed back
- They're talking about [[Emi]] potentially using reincarnation on [[Olivia]]
- [[Advena]] is actually just more concerned about whether or not [[Emi]] will be ok
- [[Melody]] is looking for books on slapping people with one arm?
- [[Ardric]] is talking with the grass on the side of the library because [[Ave]] wandered off over there while they were inside
- We stumble upon [[Cedric]] wandering in the forest
	- He's having a terrible coughing fit
- Upon learning that [[Cain]] wants to kill [[Artemicion]], [[Cedric]] threatens to kill him again
- We arrive at the post office, and inform [[Cosmo]] about what is going on and why we're here
- [[Artemicion]] just left, headed to the [[Big Fae Apple]]
- We immediately leave to chase him
- [[Melody]] guides the party to the [[Big Fae Apple]]
- As we approach the bridge, there are wanted posters of a character that looks vaguely like [[Melody]], but are well worn and depict him with no beard and two arms
- A guy is trying to sell us information on where to find squirrels, so [[Melody]] walks up and tries to slap him after telling him off
- THIS KID DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE SQUIRREL IS

- The [[Fae]] has tone indicators too now
- We're all going to go by codenames while we're here for security
- We get to the lost and found names to search for [[Artemicion]]
- They want the tears of a newborn as payment
- [[Ardric]] uses shape water to extract a drop from [[Little Wyrm]]'s eye
- [[Herron]] is being forced to take this payment that he asked for, quite reluctantly
	- This is cockatrice juice, thus we have petrified a man
- [[Buttercup]] thinks this is the best thing that has happened in days, as she was clearly growing fed up of [[Herron]]
- [[Artemicion]] is perfectly healthy apart from anxiety, hypertension, and poor eyesight
	- He's currently heading to [[The Door]]
- [[The Door]] is to the northside
- [[Cedric]] is using the services here to check on [[Barren Height|Barren]]
	- He's currently not moving, staying at a town called [[Serenity]]
	- Conflicted, but enjoying his time there which is the root of the conflict
	- Other names attached to his name
		- Language [[Buttercup]] cannot read, and constantly shifting
- [[Olivia]] is inquiring about the name [[Quiet Peak]]
	- Doesn't have a body, but is alive?
	- Currently with someone named [[Serene Valley]]
- [[Cedric]] has been hearing voices?!
- [[Advena]] is checking up on [[Greelee]]
- Currently thinking exclusively about a telescope
- [[Advena]] is now asking about [[Advena]] to see what comes up
	- The books do not move?
	- The books definitely do not know anything about [[Advena]]
	- Could be an issue with it being a chosen name
	- Huge gap missing from when the name was started to be used
	- [[Cain]] comes up a lot
	- Her eyes open briefly before she grabs the paper shreds it and throws it in the bag
		- the name "[[Cain]]" looked at [[Buttercup]] as if it knew we were looking
- [[Ave]] searches for the name [[Awan]]
	- A dusty piece of paper turns up, saying that she's alive but petrified
	- Currently in a museum owned by a lord who enjoys soup

	- Lot of mentions of blood
	- Having trouble holding back something currently
- [[Cedric]] wants to know about [[Serene Valley]]
	- Related to [[Quiet Peak]]
	- The entire page is covered in the gibberish that was on [[Barren Height|Barren]]'s page
	- Everyone has to do a perception check now
- As [[Cedric]]'s reading the paper, his eyes turn to spirals and he begins hearing the voices
- The paper now becomes blank as the spirals fade from his eyes
- [[Ardric]] specifically requests to shake [[Buttercup]]'s hand so he can cast a dedication ceremony on her
- We make our way to [[The Door]]
- [[Advena]] casts intellect fortress on [[Fish]] and [[Ave]]
- We hear a voice off to the side as we try to find our way
- It turns out to be a hag named [[Miriel]] who knew [[Olivia|Ruby]] when she was little
- She's been getting visions from [[Sehanine]]
- She draws a door in the water for us, and we go through
- One of the [[Elegist]]s is waiting for us, and greets us
- They promise not to bring harm to us today
- We're led to a temple through a ghost town of a city
- Several [[Elegist]]s seems to be channeling something in the middle of the room
- [[Olivia]] and [[Ave]] fail charisma saves on the voices of the two who came to meet us
- The [[Elegist]]s want peace
	- They have conditions that must be upheld
	- They want to come back into the [[Fae Wild]] if possible
	- [[Melody]] is one of the conditions for them coming back
	- They require [[Melody]]'s services for their new master
	- Their new master seems to be [[Cain]]
- The conditions are quite simple:
	- They give [[Melody]] a crown that looks identical to [[Ardric]]'s and tell him he must put it on
- [[Melody]] says we cannot ally ourselves with [[Cain]] as it would be akin to the [[Elegist]]s aligning themselves with [[Cadence]]
- He requests for at least the rest of the group to be left out of this, but they say it's too late and we're already a part of this mechanism
- Apparently if [[Cain]] triumphs, it could give the [[Elegist]]s back their childhoods somehow
- [[Cain]] took memories away from some of the [[Elegist]]s who couldn't bare to keep living in reality
	- They insinuate that this is what happened with [[Advena]]
- They tell [[Ave]] that [[Cain]] said she could join him as a family again and he would love it, saying that [[Ardric]] twisted the truth on her. Unfortunately, [[Ave]] is charmed by them
- [[Ardric]] sends a message of warning to [[Refrain]]
- oh yeah, we also picked up [[Artemicion]] on our way out of the [[Elegist]] space
- According to [[Artemicion]], the [[Elegist]]s don't have any actual weapons
- The [[Elegist]]s were unable to talk about the [[Drow]] when inquired about by [[Artemicion]]
- Malicious fairies can take memories from people if they have your name
- We're heading to [[Fried Something]] now
- Identify doesn't work on [[Artemicion]]
- This squirrel has a spell jammer on him somehow
